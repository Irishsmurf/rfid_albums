# Function dependencies
firebase-admin>=6.0.0,<7.0.0
requests>=2.25.0,<3.0.0
# google-cloud-firestore is included with firebase-admin, but explicit is fine
# google-cloud-pubsub is for publishing, not usually needed for trigger consumption by function itself.
# The execution environment provides the Pub/Sub trigger payload.
